## Overview

This project involves designing and implementing a Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence (DW & BI) solution using a healthcare-related OLTP dataset. The goal is to enable effective analytics and reporting by transforming transactional healthcare data into a dimensional star schema format using ETL processes.
